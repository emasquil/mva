## Numerical Tours

The course had 4 numerical tours. These consisted in Jupyter Notebooks we had to run with our own data, and briefly comment on the results. Some of them required some implementations too.

## Project
### Optimal transport mapping via input convex neural networks

The course evaluation was done over a project, which consisted in reading a scientific article and performing numerical experiments with the proposed method.

I worked on [Optimal transport mapping via input convex neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10962):

* Implementation of the proposed algorithm from scratch
* Experimental tests across different datasets and comparison with traditional methods
