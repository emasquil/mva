# Probabilistic Graphical Models
This course provides a unifying introduction to probabilistic modelling through the framework of graphical models, together with their associated learning and inference algorithms.

1. The [first homework](homework-1) consisted in theoretical and implementation exercises on: linear classification and the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models

2. The [second homework](homework-2) consisted only in implementation exercises: Gaussian Processes and Importance Weighted Autoencoders
