# Convex Optimization

The course contained 2 asssignments in paper (math exercises), and 1 math + coding assignment.

* [Homework 1: convex sets and convex functions](HW1.pdf)
* [Homework 2: duality](HW2.pdf)
* [Homework 3: Newton's method](HW3.pdf)

My solutions to each of the assignments are the `homeworkn.pdf` `homeworkn.ipynb` files.
