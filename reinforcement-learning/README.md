# Reinforcement Learning
Introduction to the models and mathematical tools used in formalizing the problem of learning and decision-making under uncertainty. In particular, we will focus on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and multi-arm bandit.

All assignments consisted in theoretical and implementation exercises.

1. [First homework](homework-1): Dynamic Programming, Tabular RL and RL with Function Approximation.

2. [Second homework](homework-2): DQN, REINFORCE and Model Selection.

3. [Third homework](homework-3): Exploration and Representation Learning
